# Notes 

### ToDo:
- organize which starting material is needed (70 mm or 45/50 mm if we dont want to forge before)
- update notebooks
- update script
- check with technicians if we can roll Aluminum in Trio - maybe need to clean rolls afterwards with steel 


### Idea of this part of the course
- students should develop the pass sequence themselves
  - on the trio this is difficult though, as we cant really choose which grooves to use and the roll gaps are also, while variable, rather fixed
  - but if we roll both Al and Fe they can see the differences in using different materials
